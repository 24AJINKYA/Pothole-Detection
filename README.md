# Pothole Detection using YOLOv8
This repository contains the implementation of an object detection model specifically designed for pothole detection. The model is trained using the YOLOv8s architecture, which is selected for its balance of speed and accuracy.

## Model Overview
YOLOv8 offers multiple model variants (s, n, l, x), each catering to different use cases based on computational resources and performance needs. For this project, we have employed the YOLOv8s model, which is optimized for faster inference while maintaining good detection accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is compiled from various sources:
•	Kaggle: A collection of publicly available images.
•	Locality: Images captured from local areas to add diversity and real-world scenarios to the dataset.

## Training Details
•	**Image Size**: 640x640 pixels

•	**Epochs**: 50

•	**Early Stopping**: The model training uses the patience parameter set to 5, which means training stops if there is no improvement in the validation metrics for 5 consecutive epochs.

•	**Weights Storage**: Upon completion of training, the model stores the final weights in the best.pt file located in the weights section.

#
The trained model can accurately detect potholes in various conditions, providing a reliable solution for road safety and maintenance applications.

# Steps for Pothole Detection using YOLOv8
## 1. Deciding the Topic

Objective: Detect potholes in images and videos using an object detection model.

## 2. Preparing the Dataset

**Collecting Data**: Gather images from various sources such as Kaggle and local areas to ensure a diverse dataset.

**Preprocessing:** Resize images to a consistent size (640x640 pixels) and perform any necessary image enhancements or augmentations.

## 3. Annotating Images

**Tools**: Use annotation tools like LabelImg, CVAT, or VGG Image Annotator (VIA) to label the potholes in the images.

**Annotations**: Save annotations in a format compatible with YOLO (e.g., YOLO txt format).

## 4. Preparing the Dataset

**Splitting Data**: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. A typical split might be 70% training, 20% validation, and 10% testing.

## 5. Training the Object Detection Model

**Model Selection:** Choose the YOLOv8s model for its balance of speed and accuracy.

### Model Architecture:

**model:** Specifies the model architecture to use. For example, yolov8s.pt.


**data:** Path to the dataset configuration file (usually a YAML file) that contains information about the dataset structure and classes.


**imgsz:** The size of the input images (e.g., 640 for 640x640 pixels).


**epochs:** Number of training epochs. Example: epochs=50.
Batch Size:

**batch:** Number of images per batch. Example: batch=16.

**lr0:** Initial learning rate. Example: lr0=0.01.

**patience:** Number of epochs with no improvement after which training will be stopped. Example: patience=5.
Weight Initialization:

**weights:** Path to pretrained weights file. Use weights='' to train from scratch or specify a path to resume training from a checkpoint.

**optimizer:** Optimizer to use for training (e.g., SGD, Adam).
Augmentation:

**augment:** Apply data augmentation techniques during training to improve generalization.

**hyp:** Path to a YAML file containing hyperparameter settings.

**device:** Device to use for training (0 for GPU, cpu for CPU).

## 6. Validating the Results
**Validation**: Evaluate the model on the validation set to monitor performance and adjust hyperparameters if necessary.

**Metrics:** Track metrics such as precision, recall, and mAP (mean Average Precision).

## 7. Testing the Model
**Inference:** Run the trained model on the test set or new images/videos to detect potholes.

#### If you want to  Train the model in the Google collab which is a opensource and free platform which provides a good Computational power then just make a new notebook in the collab and then you can start the training and testing , validation by using the same code provided here in collab also. Connect runtime to T4 GPU it will provide a faster speed for computation.
